Icons (`.{{cssPrefix}}icon`) are white by default, and their container (`.{{cssPrefix}}icon_container`) has a transparent background.

### Changing the color of an icon

Icon color is changed using the `fill` CSS property.
You may also use these helper classes:

- `.{{cssPrefix}}icon-text-default`: same as default text
- `.{{cssPrefix}}icon-text-warning`: yellow
- `.{{cssPrefix}}icon-text-error`: red

### Note on “doctype” icons

Note that [doctype icons](/icons/#doctype) have specific colors that cannot be changed with the `fill` CSS property.
