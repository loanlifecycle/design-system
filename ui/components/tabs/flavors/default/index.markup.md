The default tab set style encapsulates everything that is underneath it without enclosing it visually. Initialize a default tab set by applying the `.{{cssPrefix}}tab--default` class to the containing `<div>` around the tab list and tab panels. The `<ul>` element also requires the class `.{{cssPrefix}}tab--default__nav` to prevent styles from bleeding into nested tabs.

The overflow tab style is provided as a tab item type that acts as a menu component and appears as a tab item. It could contain those tab items that don't all fit in a horizontal orientation. Initialize a default tab set and in the last tab item of the set, apply the additional classes `{{cssPrefix}}dropdown-trigger` and `.{{cssPrefix}}tabs__item--overflow`. Include an `<a>` element to contain the tab item label like the other tab items. After the `<a>` element, the `.{{cssPrefix}}dropdown` segment of a search overflow menu component is used. The `{{cssPrefix}}dropdown__list` element also then requires a `{{cssPrefix}}dropdown--length-X` class, where X is the number of items to show in it.
