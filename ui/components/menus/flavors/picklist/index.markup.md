A picklist is a list of actionable items that is invoked by selection of a particular item. That value is then shown as selected and its value is updated within the `{{cssPrefix}}picklist__label`. The picklist menu options are usually displayed within a `{{cssPrefix}}dropdown` as its presentation layer and will scroll if there are more than five items included.

A multi-select picklist is a list of actionable items that is invoked by selection of a particular item(s). The multi-select picklist can have more than one selected option. When more than one option has been selected, the `.{{cssPrefix}}picklist__label` test should update with the total number of selected items, such as "3 options selected". When the picklist loses focus but has items selected, a `.{{cssPrefix}}pill_container--bare` should be display below the `.{{cssPrefix}}picklist__label` with the selected items in pills, allowing a user to easily remove selected items.
